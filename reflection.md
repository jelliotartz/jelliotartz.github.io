##### What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

When thinking about the positioning of an element, *DO NOT* ignore these values! They are integral components when seeking to place an element on a page. I learned that although I got some good practice this week, I still have a lot to learn about proper and efficient positioning, and I don't really have a complete understanding of how to effectively and efficiently manipulate padding, borders, and margin.

##### What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that what seems like a relatively easy concept (positioning an element) is actually **really** hard! I had to get up and walk away a few times, I got so frustrated with positioning issues. Nothing is easy when it comes to CSS positioning.

##### What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Nothing was particularly easy about my CSS experience with my website. Positioning took forever. Margins and borders flummoxed me for hours. I got hung up on tiny details (why does my footer not have a nice border around it, but the header does?) and knew I was taking too much time to figure out something obvious. Walking away was helpful. CSS is frustrating.

On the plus side, using the "debug" trick from J. Ky Marsh's video (adding a 1px red border around elements while working on them) was a big help. At least with the debug class activated I could see the outer border of each individual element, and watch it not do what I wanted it to do.

##### What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I need a lot more practice. The idea of CSS and HTML seems like it shouldn't be incredibly complicated, but as soon as I got into even the most basic of tasks, nothing went smoothly.
