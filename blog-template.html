How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It went really well! Karla and I set up a workflow where she made her wireframe and I navigated/added some creative comments, and then we switched roles while I made mine. Karla was using an online app called Mockflow, which was very cool. I liked it more than Pencil and Mockingbird, which I had tried previously.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes. I think it makes sense to have a wireframing stage in the development process.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

Header and footer sections, with a main body for the content of the blog post. We added a sidebar with links to other posts. Karla added a picture with hers, but I left mine out.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

Unfortunately at this point I'm still mostly using <p>, <img src=""> and <a href>. I'd like to add a reading position indicator at some point, but I think that's best reserved for later (I need to learn javascript and CSS before I can do that.) I'd also like to add scroll bars to the body sections, but again, I think that requires use of CSS.
