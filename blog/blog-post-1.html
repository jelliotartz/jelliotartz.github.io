<h1>Post #1</h1>
<h2>DBC Week 1 (almost) finished!</h2>
<h2>10.2.2015</h2>

<section>
  <h2>Welcome to my DBC blog! I'm relatively new to the idea of creating my own blog, and am excited about sharing my experiences as I work my way through DBC. At this point I've gone through most of the Week 1 challenges. I completed the challenges with some difficulty, but overall nothing was scary enough to send me running for the hills.
  </h2>

  <h2>
  Over the course of the week I successfully worked through a few hiccups, which actually felt pretty good. I can remember in years past getting furiously frustrated when I couldn't figure out how to fix a computer-related problem, being forced to call tech support, losing hours of productivity time, and eventually finding out that the solution was only a few quick easy steps that I should have just tried on my own. My hiccup-solving experience was much smoother this time, and it felt great to not lose my cool over it. Incidentally, when I ran into the problem (a little branch/master rat's nest of extra directories that created pull errors), I took a break and went for a walk. When I came back, the problem seemed more manageable, and I worked through it pretty easily (deleted the problematic directories, backed up a few steps, and got the result I was looking for). I wholly endorse the 'walk away from the problem' step when one runs into hiccups.

  <h2>Below are questions from DBC that I'll be addressing in this post.</h2>

    <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
  </header>

  <h4>
    Version control is beneficial because projects are often being worked on by multiple developers, creating the risk of one developer overwriting the work of another, or data loss. Version control minimizes the risk of data loss by creating branches that each developer works on, eventually merging their work into the 'master' when it is ready. By separating each developer's work into branches, the risk of data loss is minimal.

    <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
  </header>

  <h4>
    The use of branches helps you keep track of changes in git. When you create a branch, you have a clear point that you can easily reference as your 'jumping off point'. Then, while you are working on your branch, you add and commit changes as often as you like, creating more points that you can return to if something ends up going wrong.
  </h4>

  <h4>
    Once you are done with your work and have pushed it up onto GitHub, changes are tracked via pull requests. This allows other people working on the project to view your work and be aware of it before it gets merged into the master branch.
  </h4>

  <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>

  <h4>
    Storing code on GitHub fosters easy collaboration during the course of a project, and provides an easy and logical way to track changes as a project evolves. It also provides an open source environment where developers can find your source code if it could be useful for other projects.
